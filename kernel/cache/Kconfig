	  	Dcache is a independent continuous disk cache.
		
		If you want to use it, you need to reserve some memory for cache(modify init/main.c), 
	  	then recompile and install the kernel;  the address of reserved memory usually is fixed, 
		it means the buffer is stored in the ranges of fixed physical address.
	  	
	 	It improve the speed of disk r/w without data loss, if NVDIMM is used.
		
		If unsure, say N.
